# A-Little-Dog-Game

Hi guys!
This is just a game I made to spend time and study basic JS, i used CSS3 and HTML5 too. 
I was inspired by Rafaella Ballerini to do it and I wrote in Portuguese .... 
This repository is my first one and I am thinking about not changing these codes, and in the future I will see how much I learned and maybe redeploy it! 
This is just a code to play with the result, and the game has no end, just try to keep the dog alive! 
Thank you for your attention and please don't judge me! (LOL)
