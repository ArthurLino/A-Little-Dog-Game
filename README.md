<h1>Dont-Let-The-Dog-Die</h1>
<br/>
<h5>V1</h5> 
<p>That repo contains the original game I've made some time ago. Now, the goal is to code the game once more and try to do a better version.</p>
<br/>
<h5>V2</h5>
<p>The main idea is no longer just prevent the dog's death</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
- improve UI and add some user flow
- add a way of getting more pets
- make the pets lose their stats over time
- add DB for saving user progress (firebase maybe)
