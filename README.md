<h1>Dont-Let-The-Dog-Die</h1>

### V1
That repo contains the original game I've made some time ago. Now, the goal is to code the game once more and try to do a better version.


### V2
The main idea is no longer just prevent the dog's death...
Some ideas (for now):
- [ ] Improve UI and add some user flow
- [ ] Add a way of getting more pets
- [ ] Make the pets lose their stats over time
- [ ] Add DB for saving user progress (firebase maybe)
